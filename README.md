# Active Learning 4 Machine Learning

This repository will contain code and or results that belong to the AI4ML project at HTW Dresden lead by Prof. Maik Thiele.

## Automatic Augmentations

The contents of **Automatic Augmentations** are the result of a group project looking for automatic augmentation strategies which shall later be used together with Active Learning. It was worked on by Colin Simon, Kevin Kirsten and Serhiy Bolkun.

In this project we used the training code and dataset from MedMNIST [1]

We were also using the augmentation library supplied by TrivialAugment. [2]

And we applied an augmentation strategy that was searched for using DeepAugment [3]
